# Mohammad Shahadat Ali Mollah,ID 1802044

## 📌 Introduction

In an era dominated by digital transformation, cyber threats pose serious risks to individuals, institutions, and national security. As digital connectivity expands in Bangladesh, there is a critical need to assess and strengthen the country's cyber laws. This document explores the current state of cyber law in Bangladesh, examines best practices from leading countries, and proposes a reformed legal framework to build a resilient digital future.

## 🇧🇩 Existing Cyber Law in Bangladesh

### Digital Security Act, 2018

Bangladesh's primary legislation governing cyberspace is the **Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018**. While it was enacted to combat cybercrime and ensure digital security, it has drawn criticism for vague provisions, potential abuse against freedom of speech, and lack of transparency.

**Key Features:**
- Addresses cybercrime, including hacking, identity theft, and digital fraud.
- Criminalizes digital propaganda and defamation.
- Provides authority to law enforcement for arrest and seizure without warrant in some cases.

**Criticism:**
- Broad definitions leading to arbitrary enforcement.
- Restrictions on freedom of expression.
- Inadequate safeguards for personal data and privacy.
